Where are EBS snapshots stored?,EBS snapshots are stored in S3.,ec2,
"What is meant by EBS snapshots being ""incremental""?",Incremental means that the first snapshot is a full copy of the data on the volume. Subsequent snapshots are stored as the changes from the previous snapshots. This results in less storage usage.,ec2,
"If you delete an incremental EBS snapshot, do later snapshots become unreachable?","No, when an incremental EBS snapshot is deleted, the system makes sure later snapshots are still valid.",ec2,
How does the performance of a newly created EBS volume compare with that of an EBS volume restored from a snapshot?,"A new EBS volume immediately has full performance. However, a volume restored from a snapshot is restored lazily, meaning its contents are fetched gradually. Requested blocks are fetched immediately. It can be restored to full performance by deliberately requesting to read all of its data.",ec2,
What is Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)?,"Fast Snapshot Restore immediately restores EBS volumes from snapshots, without having to wait for gradual restoration or requesting to read all of its data.",ec2,
Is there a limit on how many Fast Snapshot Restores you can have?,"Yes, you can have up to 50 FSRs per region. Each individual snapshot restored to an AZ takes up one of these.",ec2,
How are you billed for EBS snapshots?,"EBS snapshots are billed by gigabyte-per-month usage. Only used data is considered, not total allocated data.",ec2,
Can you set AWS accounts to encrypt EBS volumes by default?,Yes. You can also set the default CMK to use for this encryption.,ec2,
What is a data encryption key? What is it used for?,A data encryption key is an encrypted key that is generated by a CMK. It is stored with the data volume it was created for and can only be decrypted by KMS. The decrypted form of this key is only ever stored in memory of an EC2 host while it's being used.,ec2,
Does it cost extra to use data encryption in EBS volumes?,"No, there is no extra cost to encrypting EBS volumes. It should be used by default.",ec2,
What happens when you make a snapshot of an encrypted EBS volume?,"The same data encryption key is used for the snapshot and any subsequent snapshots. Addtionally, volumes made from those snapshots use the same key.",ec2,
Can you change an encrypted volume to a not-encrypted volume?,"No, once you encrypt a volume, it stays that way.",ec2,
Is the operating system aware of encryption?,"No, the operating system is not aware of encryption. It only sees plaintext. If the OS itself needs to work with encryption, then disk encryption within the OS is needed. This can reduce performance.",ec2,
Are public IPv4 addresses static or dynamic?,Public IPv4 addresses are dynamic.,ec2,
What happens to the public IPv4 address when you get an elastic IP?,"When you get an elastic IP, the public IPv4 address is removed and replaced with the elastic IP. If the elastic IP is then removed, you get a new public IPv4 which is different from the former one.",ec2,
What kind of addresses do network interfaces have?,"Network interfaces have: a primary IPv4 private IP, optional secondary IPs, an optional public IPv4 address, an optional elastic IP which replaces the private IPv4 address, and optional IPv6 addresses.",ec2,
Do you ever have to configure a public IPv4 address for an EC2 instance?,"No, the public IPv4 address is handled by NAT. The OS is never aware of its public IPv4. You only have to configure a private IPv4 address.",vpc,
"If you stop and start an EC2 instance, will it still have the same IPv4 Public IP?","No, IPv4 public IPs are allocated dynamically. Once you start the EC2 instance again, it will be given a new IPv4 public IP. Note: if you restart the instance, the IPv4 public IP is kept.",vpc,
Can an AMI be used to launch an EC2 instance in any region?,"No, AMIs are regional; they are tied to a specific region.",ec2,
Can an AMI be edited once it is made?,"No, AMIs cannot be edited. You need to launch the instance, update the configuration, and make a new AMI.",ec2,
What are the two cluster modes that ECS can be run in?,ECS can be run in EC2 mode or Fargate mode.,ecs,
How does ECS run containers?,"You give ECS a container image, and ECS runs that container image in a cluster.",ecs,
How does ECS get access to your container images?,"To get ECS access to your container images, you can use a container registry such as Elastic Container Registry or DockerHub.",ecs,

What is the user data IP address?,http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data,ec2,
Walk through the process of bootstrapping an EC2 instance.,"An AMI is used to launch an EC2 instance. This creates an EBS volume which is connected to the instance. Then, the EC2 service provides user data to the instace. The instance runs the executes the contents of user data on launch.",ec2,
What are some downsides of passing in scripts via user data?,"Scripts that are incorrect are executed anyway. Also, user data is not secure as it can be accessed by anyone connected to the instance. Passwords, credentials, and other sensitive data should not be stored in user data.",ec2,
What is the size limit of user data?,16 KB,ec2,
How is user data encoded?,Base-64 encoding,ec2,
How many times is user data executed?,"User data is executed once, at launch.",ec2,
Can an instance's user data be modified?,"Yes, an instance's user data can be modified, but only when the instance is stopped.",ec2,

What is CFN-INIT (CloudFormation Init) used for?,CFN-INIT is used for passing complex bootstrapping instructions into an EC2 instance.,ec2,
How does CFN-INIT differ from user data?,"User data is procedural, which means that it contains a sequence of steps. While CFN-INIT can be procedural, it can also be used in a 'desired state' manner. This means that the user can define a desired state, and CFN-INIT will perform steps necessary to achieve that state.",ec2,
How is CFN-INIT executed?,CFN-INIT is executed with directives provided via user data. This is defined in a section of CloudFormation templates called AWS::CloudFormation::Init. This section is in the Metadata section of EC2Instance. The CFN-INIT command itself is executed from user data.,ec2,
Can CFN-INIT be executed after launch time?,"Yes, CFN-INIT works with stack updates. It can watch for changes in metadata in its CFN template and execute steps needed to update the desired state.",ec2,
What are signals used for in CFN-INIT?,Signals can be used to notify CFN if post-launch configuration is successful. A timeout is defined in the CreationPolicy section of the CFN template.,ec2,
What is an instance profile?,The instance profile is a wrapper around an IAM role. It has the same name as its IAM role and is attached to an EC2 instance to provide permissions. Temporary credentials are delivered via instance metadata.,ec2,

What are public parameters?,Public parameters are parameters that are publicly available and provided by AWS. An example is AMI IDs for launching EC2 instances via CFN.,ec2,
Can CloudWatch Logs log data inside an EC2 instance? (e.g. CPU usage by programs),"No, CloudWatch Logs can only log data at an AWS service level, but not at an operating system level. A CloudWatch Agent is required to log OS-level data in an EC2 instance.",ec2,
What steps are necessary to log system and application data from an EC2 instance?,"Security and permissions need to be configured, and the CloudWatch Agent must be installed.",ec2,
What are EC2 placement groups used for?,EC2 placement groups define how EC2 instances are physically positioned relative to each other.,ec2,
What are the three kinds of EC2 placement groups?,Cluster: pack instances close together. Spread: keep instances separated. Partition: groups of instances spread apart.,ec2,
What are the pros and cons of using cluster placement?,"Cluster placement has high performance due to all instances having direct connections to each other. Because of this, they all belong to the same AZ which means that if the AZ fails, all instances fail. Also, only supported instance types can be clustered.",ec2,
How can you achieve 10 Gbps single stream performance using EC2?,You can achieve 10 Gbps single stream performance using EC2 by using cluster placement groups.,ec2,
What are the pros and cons of using spread placement?,Spread placement groups have high availability and resilience. Each instance runs on a different rack and won't impact one another.,ec2,

"Using spread placement, how many instances can be in the same AZ?","When using spread placement, you can have up to 7 instances in the same AZ.",ec2,
How are partition placement groups different from spread placement groups?,"In partition placement groups, you define up to 7 partitions in an AZ. In each partition, you can launch a variable number of instances. This is different from spread partition groups which assigns each instance to a different partition.",ec2,
What are the pros and cons of using partition placement?,"Partition placement gives you greater control over how instances are grouped, but it introduces more administrative overhead as this is done manually.",ec2,
What is an EC2 dedicated host? What options are available?,An EC2 dedicated host is an EC2 host that is dedicated specifically for your personal use. There are on-demand and reserved options available.,ec2,
What are some limitations of EC2 dedicated hosts?,"EC2 dedicated hosts do not support RHEL, SUSE Linux, or Windows AMIs. EC2 dedicated hosts do not support Amazon RDS instances or placement groups.",ec2,
How does enhanced networking work?,"Enhanced networking uses SR-IOV, in which the NIC (Network Interface Card) is virtualization aware.",ec2,
What benefits does enhanced networking provide?,"Enhanced networking provides higher I/O, lower host CPU usage, more bandwidth, higher packets-per-second, and consistent lower latency.",ec2,
What is EBS optimized?,"In EBS optimized, stack optimizations and dedicated capacity are provided to an EBS volume.",ec2,
Do all EBS volumes have EBS optimized?,"Most instances support EBS optimized and have it enabled by default. For some instances, enabling it costs extra.",ec2,
What are the two consistency models of databases?,ACID and BASE,db,
What do ACID and BASE stand for?,ACID: Atomic Consistent Isolated Durable. BASE: Basically Available Soft State Eventually Consistent.,db,
What is the difference between ACID and BASE?,"ACID databases ensure consistency, meaning that when data is read, it is updated. BASE does not ensure consistency and defers to the developer to ensure consistency. BASE is highly scalable as it does not need to worry about consistency. RDS are ACID, NoSQL databases are BASE.",db,
"Running databases on EC2 is generally discouraged, but what are some reasons why you might want to?","You might want to run a database on EC2 if: you want access to the DB instance OS, you need advanced DB option tuning, you need a DB or DB version not provided by AWS, you need a specific OS/DB combination, you need a specific architecture, or for whatever reason your boss just wants you to.",db,
What are some reasons to not run databases on EC2?,"Admin overhead, additional backup overhead, EC2 is single AZ, AWS DB products generally have more features, EC2 is hard to scale, need to configure replication, not optimized",db,
Is it entirely accurate to call RDS a Database-as-a-service (DBaaS)?,Not quite. RDS is more of a Database-Server-as-a-service. RDS provides you with a managed database instance. You can make one or more databases on that instance.,db,

Can a standby replica be used to scale up the number of reads?,"No, a standby replica cannot be used directly. It cannot be accessed unless there is a failover.",db,
How long does RDS failover usually take?,60 - 120 seconds,db,
Can a standby replica be in another region?,"No, multi-AZ can only be configured using other AZs in the same region.",db,
Does a standby replica provide any performance improvements?,Backups are taken from the standby which removes the impact of backing up the primary instance.,db,
Explain RPO (Recovery Point Objective),RPO refers to the time between a database failure and the last backup. It gives a measure of amount of maximum data loss. Lower values require more costly solutions.,db,
Explain RTO (Recovery Time Objective),RTO refers to the time between a database failure and when the database is returned to service. Lower values require more costly solutions.,db,

Are automatic backups always made from the primary RDS instance?,"Automatic backups are only made from the primary RDS instance if multi-AZ is not enabled. Otherwise, the standby instance is always used.",db,
How are RDS snapshots stored?,RDS snapshots are stored in S3 incrementally. They are stored permanently until you delete them manually.,db,
Does AWS make snapshots of individual databases?,"No, AWS makes snapshots of entire database instances, which means all databases on that instance are in the snapshot.",db,
What are transaction logs?,"Transaction logs are logs of database transactions that are taken every 5 minutes. They can be used to bring a database back to an updated state, which results in low RPO.",db,
What happens when you restore an RDS instance from a snapshot?,"An RDS instance restored from a snapshot will have a new address, meaning that applications connected to the original instance will need addresses updated. If databases are large, restore can be slow.",db,
What can backups protect from that replication cannot?,"Backups can protect from data corruption because you can restore databases to a point from before the corruption happened. However, replication will replicate the corrupted data.",db,
Is data replicated synchronously to read replicas?,"No, data is replicated asynchronously to read replicas.",db,
Does a read replica need to be in the same region as the original RDS instance?,"No, a read replica can be in a separate region from the original RDS instance. This is called a cross-region read replica.",db,
How many direct read-replicas can a DB instance have?,A DB instance can have 5 read replicas,db,
Can read replicas have read replicas?,"Yes, read replicas can have read replicas but lag starts to be a problem",db,
How can read replicas provide low RTO values?,"A read replica can be promoted quickly to a main DB instance. At that point, it can be both read from and written to.",db,
Can read replicas protect against data corruption?,"No, corrupted data is replicated to replicas. To recover from data corruption, you need to use snapshots and backups.",db,

What kinds of encryption are avaliable for RDS?,RDS supports SSL/TLS (in-transit) encryption as well as EBS volume encryption via KMS.,db,
What kind of encryption are available for Microsoft SQL and Oracle?,"MSSQL and Oracle support TLE: Transparent Data Encryption. Encryption is handled within the DB engine, not the host. This means there is less trust. Additionally, Oracle supports integration with CloudHSM which is even more secure.", db,
Can you configure RDS to require authentication beyond the DB username and password?,"Yes, you can configure RDS to require IAM authentication via an AWS authentication token.",db,
How is an RDS AWS authentication token generated?,The IAM user or EC2 role has a policy attached to it that maps it to the local RDS user. This gives access to the generate-db-auth-token operation which creates a token with a 15 minute validity which can be used in place of a DB username and password.,db,

Describe Aurora's backtrack feature.,"If Aurora's backtrack feature is enabled, Aurora can rollback to a past point in time in-place.",db,
Describe Aurora's fast clone feature.,A fast clone references the original database and only stores differences between itself and that database. This makes it consume a low amount of storage.,db,
How does Aurora Serverless work?,"Aurora Serverless uses ACUs (Aurora Capacity Units). You can set a minimum and maximum ACU for an Aurora Serverless cluster, and the cluster will adjust based on load. If load is 0, the instance is paused. The user is billed on a per-second basis.",db,
What are some use cases for Aurora Serverless?,"Infrequently used apps, experimental apps, variable or unpredictable workloads, dev and test databases, multi-tenant apps",db,
How does Aurora Serverless' architecture differ from standard Aurora?,"Because Aurora Serverless instances are dynamic, Aurora Serverless uses a fleet of proxy instances to broker connects between apps and Aurora Serverless DB instances.",db,

How does delegation work in DNS?,"Delegation is the process wherein DNS servers delegate trust to another server. For example, when you find the root zone, it will delegate trust to another server which is authoritative for .com. The server that is authoritative for .com will delegate trust to another server which is authoritative for amazon.com.",dns,
Walk through a DNS lookup for www.amazon.com.,"First, our client asks a resolver server. The resolver server uses its root hints file to access the DNS root servers. The DNS root servers are only authoritative for the end of the URL, so it delegates for .com. Next, our resolver server accesses the .com  server. It is authoritative for .com but not amazon.com - however, it has name servers for amazon.com. Next, the resolver accesses servers that are authoritative for amazon.com. At this point, the resolver has what it needs to access www.amazon.com.",dns,
What is the root hints file?,The root hints file points at the root servers IPs and addresses.,dns,
What two functions are provided by Route 53?,Route 53 allows you to register domains and host zones files on managed nameservers.,dns,
What level of resiliency does Route 53 have?,Route 53 is globally resilient.,dns,

What is a hosted zone?,A hosted zone is the AWS terminology for a zone file. It contains DNS records and is hosted on four managed nameservers.,dns,
Can a hosted zone be private?,"Yes, a hosted zone can be private or public. If it is private, it is linked to VPCs and only accessible within those VPCs.",dns,
What are the different types of DNS records?,"A (IPv4), AAAA (IPv6), CNAME (point to other names), MX (mail server), TXT (add arbitrary text to a domain)",dns,
What is time to live (TTL)?,TTL is a time limit for caching a non-authoritative answer. (An authoritative answer is a direct answer from a nameserver),dns,
What is split-view?,Split-view is having overlapping public and private zones for public and internal use with the same zone name.,dns,
What is the difference between an A record and a CNAME record?,An A record maps a name to an IP address, i.e. twitch.tv -> 1.3.3.7. A CNAME record maps a name to another name i.e. twitch.tv -> multitwitch.tv.,dns
Why would you use an ALIAS instead of a CNAME?,CNAMEs can only point a NAME to another NAME. A CNAME cannot be used for a naked domain name e.g. catagram.io. An ALIAS record maps a NAME to an AWS resource and can be used for naked/apex records.,dns,
What are ALIAS types?,ALIAS records have types which correspond to the types of DNS records i.e. A-type ALIAS. An ALIAS record should be the same type as what the record is pointing at.,dns,
Describe simple routing.,Simple routing supports 1 record per name. Each record can have multiple values and all values are returned to the client in a random order. The client chooses 1 value among these. Simple routing doesn't support health checks.,dns,
When is simple routing used?,Simple routing is used when you want to route requests towards one service such as a web server.,dns,
How are health checks executed?,Health checks are executed by a fleet of distributed health checkers which are located globally.,dns,
How often are health checks executed?,Health checks are executed ever 30 seconds. Every 10 seconds is an additional option that costs extra.,dns,
Describe failover routing.,"Failover routing consists of multiple records for the same name. Each record points to a different resource. Health checks are done on the primary record. If it is healthy, traffic is routed to the primary. If it is not healthy, traffic is routed to the secondary.",dns,
What is failover routing used for?,Failover routing is used to configure active passive failover.,dns,
Describe multi-value routing.,Multi-value routing supports multiple records with the same name. All can be configured to be health-checked. DNS will return up to 8 healthy ones at random.,dns,
What benefits does multi-value routing provide?,Multi-value routing improves availability.,dns,
Describe weighted routing.,"Weighted routing allows you to set a weight to each record, which indicates the probability that a request will be forwarded to that record.",dns,
What is weighted routing used for?,"Weighted routing is used for simple load balancing or testing new software versions. For example, if you want 5% of traffic to go to a new version of an app.",dns,
Describe latency routing.,Latency routing supports one record with the same name in each AWS region. AWS maintains a database of latency between users’ general location and records’ regions.,dns,
What is latency routing used for?,Latency routing is used to optimize performance and user experience.,dns,
Describe geolocation routing.,Geolocation routing is used to direct traffic based strictly on the location of the user.,dns,

What kind of connections are supported by load balancers?,"EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda, HTTPS, HTTP/2 and Websockets",elb,
What is SNI? How is it used by ALB?,SNI is Server Name Indication. ALB uses it to have multiple SSL certificates attached. Host-based rules can direct individual domain names using SSL certificates at different target groups.,elb,
What do launch configurations and launch templates allow you to do?,LCs and LTs allow you to define the configuration of an EC2 instance in advance.,elb,
What parameters do LCs and LTs allow you to define?,"AMI, instance type, storage, key pair, networking and security groups, user data and IAM role",elb,
What is the difference between launch configurations and launch templates?,"LTs are newer and have the following features not provided by LCs: versioning, T2/T3 unlimited, placement groups, capacity reservations, elastic graphics",elb,
How do launch configurations and launch templates differ in terms of use cases?,LCs provide configuration of EC2 instances in Auto Scaling Groups. LTs do the same thing but can also be used to launch EC2 instances directly.,elb,
What is an auto scaling group?,An auto scaling group provides auto scaling for EC2. It allows an EC2 architecture to be self-healing.,elb,
How does an auto scaling group know how much to scale?,"An auto scaling group has a minimum, desired, and maximum size.",elb,
"In auto scaling groups, what are minimum, desired, and maximum capacity?",Minimum and maximum are limits for capacity. Desired is between minimum and maximum and is the current target capacity for the group.,elb,
How can we automate scaling?,"We can automate scaling using scaling policies, which automatically adjust the desired capacity between minimum and maximum.",elb,
What are the different kinds of scaling policies?,"Manual, Scheduled, Dynamic",elb,
What options are available for dynamic scaling?,"Simple: based on simple rules i.e. ""CPU above 50% +1"". Stepped: bigger +/- based on difference. Target: ""Desired aggregate CPU = 40%""",elb,
How are cooldown periods useful for auto scaling groups?,"Cooldown periods define how much time must pass before scaling operations. Cooldown periods prevent auto scaling groups from starting too many instances, which can be costly due to their minimum billed duration.",elb,
How can you get higher granularity while using auto scaling groups?,"Use more, smaller instances",elb,
Is there a cost for using auto scaling groups?,"No, auto scaling groups are free. You only pay for the resources created by the groups.",elb,
How do ASGs and LTs differ in terms of what they define?,ASGs define when (what time / in what situations) and where (what subnet / VPC) instances are launched.  LTs define what is launched (what type of instance),elb,
How do load balancers perform abstraction?,Load balancers abstract away the instance architecture from users. Users don't have to worry about where exactly they're connecting.,elb,
What information do you need to use a launch template?,"AMI (required), instance type, key pair, network settings (VPC or EC2-classic), security groups, storage volumes, tags, network interfaces, IAM instance profile, user data",elb,
Can you use a network load balancer to regulate HTTP/S?,"No, NLBs are layer-4 and only understand TCP and UDP.",elb,
How do ALBs and NLBs compare in terms of speed?,NLBs are faster. ~100ms vs 400ms for ALBs.,elb,

What are the three SSL modes of ELBs?,"Bridging, pass-through, offload",elb,
What is the default SSL mode of an ALB?,SSL bridging,elb,
Explain SSL bridging.,Clients connect to the ELB. Listener is configured for HTTPS. Connection is terminated on the ELB and needs a certificate for the domain name. ELB connects via SSL to backend instances. Instances need SSL certs and compute required for cryptographic operations.,elb,
"When using a default ALB, how many times is data encrypted and decrypted?","When using a default ALB, data is encrypted and decrypted twice. Once between client and ALB, and once between ALB and backend instances.",elb,
Explain SSL pass-through.,"Listener is configured for TCP. No encryption between client and NLB. When NLB passes connection to backend instance, each instance needs the correct SSL cert installed.",elb,
Explain SSL offload.,Listener is configured for HTTPS. Connections are terminated and then backend connections use HTTP. Instances have no certificate or cryptographic requirements.,elb,
What are some disadvantages of SSL bridging?,"Certificate needs to be stored on ELB and instances, instances need compute for cryptographic operations",elb,
What are some disadvantages of SSL pass-through?,"No load balancing based on HTTP, instances need certificates and compute for cryptographic operations",elb,
What is session stickiness and how is it used?,Session stickiness is when clients are load balanced towards instances they have connected to before. It is used when there is data relevant to the client stored on a particular instance e.g. shopping cart data,elb,
How is session stickiness implemented?,Stickiness generates a cookie called AWSALB which locks a device to a single backend instance for a given duration.,elb,
What is the range of duration for session stickiness?,1 second to 7 days,elb,
What are two ways a sticky session can end?,"Either the cookie expires, or the EC2 instance becomes unreachable (i.e. if it is unhealthy)",elb,
How can you maintain session information without using session stickiness?,You can maintain session information by storing session data externally (not on the EC2 instance itself). One way to do so is by using DynamoDB.,elb,
Can launch templates be modified?,"No, launch templates cannot be modified.",elb,
Where are scaling policies defined?,Scaling policies are defined optionally in auto scaling groups.,elb,

How is a tiered architecture implemented?,Separation between different parts of a tiered-architecture app is done via load balancers. Load balancers abstract away specific-instance information between app parts.,svls,
What disadvantages does a tiered architecture have?,"In a tiered architecture, tiers are still dependent upon the tier below. One part expects and requires another part to respond. Also, each tier has to be running something for the app to function. The app is synchronous.",svls,
What is an event driven architecture?,"An event driven architecture consists of event producers and event consumers. Producers generate events when something happens, and the events are sent to consumers. When a consumer receives and event, actions are taken and the system returns to a waiting state.",svls,
What advantages does an even driven architecture provide?,"In an well-implemented event-driven architecture, the system only consumes resources when handling events.",svls,
What is the main advantage of Lambda over EC2?,"When using Lambda, you are billed only for the duration a function runs.",svls,

What are the different ways in which SNS messages can be received?,"HTTP(S), Email (JSON), SQS, mobile push notifications, SMS messages, Lambda",svls,
Describe the different kinds of states in a state machine.,SUCCEED & FAIL: end states. WAIT: wait for an event. CHOICE: go to one state or another depending on the value of an input. PARALLEL: go to multiple states at once. MAP: get a list as input and perform tasks for each item in the list. TASK: the actual work that gets done - do something using an AWS service.,svls,
What is SQS?,"SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a public, fully managed service that provides highly-available queues. Queues can be standard or FIFO.",svls,
What is the size limit of a message in SQS?,256 KB,svls,
What can you do if you want to have a large object in SQS?,"If your object exceeds the size limit of SQS, you can store it in S3 and link to it in SQS.",svls,
What is VisibilityTimeout? How does it benefit SQS?,VisibilityTimeout is the amount of time a message is hidden when it is received. If its time is exceeded and the message is not deleted (usually means the job was not done) the message is re-entered into the queue. This feature improves SQS’s fault tolerance.,svls,
What is a dead-letter queue?,"A dead-letter queue is a separate queue for messages that require exceptional processing tasks, or messages that are entered into queues many times but cause problems often.",svls,
How can you use SQS to generate multiple jobs in response to an S3 event?,"You can use what is called SQS fanout: you set up multiple SQS queues that are each subscribed to an SNS topic. When an S3 event (i.e. upload) occurs, a message is sent to this topic which is received by each queue. Each queue can start a separate job.",svls,
What is the difference between a standard queue and a FIFO queue?,A standard queue provides at-least-once delivery where same-order is not guaranteed. A FIFO queue provides exactly-once delivery where order is preserved. Standard queues are more scalable than FIFO queues.,svls,
What level of performance is provided by FIFO queues?,"3,000 messages per second with batching, up to 300 messages per second without",svls,
How are you billed for SQS?,Billing is based on ‘requests’. 1 request = 1 - 10 messages up to 256 KB total.,svls,
What are the two polling modes of SQS? Which is generally recommended and why?,"SQS’s two polling modes are short polling and long polling. Short polling makes requests immediately, and long polling will wait for additional messages for a configurable duration (waitTimeSeconds) before making a request. Long polling is recommended as it is more efficient.",svls,
"Does SQS support encryption? If so, is it a default feature?",Yes - SQS supports both encryption at rest via KMS and encryption in-transit. In-transit encryption is enabled by default.,svls,

What does the term ‘capacity’ mean in the context of DynamoDB?,"In the context of DynamoDB, ‘capacity’ refers to speed, not space.",ddb,
How does capacity work in DynamoDB?,Capacity is divided into write capacity and read capacity units. 1 WCU = 1 KB per second. 1 RCU = 4 KB per second.,ddb,
What backup options are available for DynamoDB?,DynamoDB provides on-demand backups and point-in-time recovery (PITR).,ddb,
What service should you use if you need a NoSQL database?,DynamoDB,ddb,
What service should you use if you need a key-value database?,DynamoDB,ddb,
How is DynamoDB billed?,"DDB is billed based on RCU, WCU, storage, and features.",ddb,
What are the two capacity modes of DynamoDB?,DynamoDB can be used in either on-demand mode or provisioned mode.,ddb,
What are the use cases for the two capacity modes of DynamoDB?,On-demand is used for unknown or unpredictable loads and has low admin. Provisioned is used for predictable loads and has RCU and WCU set on a per table basis.,ddb,
Does DynamoDB have a minimum capacity usage amount?,Yes. Every operation consumes at least 1 RCU or WCU.,ddb,
"Does DynamoDB support bursting? If so, how?",Yes. DynamoDB tables have RCU and WCU burst pools of 300 seconds.,ddb,
"If you filter out certain parts of a DynamoDB query, are you billed for only what is returned?","No, if your query filters certain fields, you are still billed for the total size of the query before filtering occurs.",ddb,
What makes the scan operation expensive?,The scan operation iterates through all items in the table. ,ddb,
What are the benefits of using the scan operation?,The scan operation gives you complete control over what data is selected. Any attributes can be used and any filters can be applied.,ddb,
What is an example of a task that can be accomplished with a scan but not a query?,"If we want to find all instances of a particular value of a field, we need to use scan.",ddb,
Describe the two consistency modes for DynamoDB reads.,"Eventual consistency: read operations will not wait for data to be fully updated. Data is available faster, but is not always updated. Strong consistency: read operations always return fully updated data. EC is easier to implement and scales better, but there are some applications that require SC.",ddb,
Why do write operations cost more than read operations?,Write operations cost more than read operations because writes must be performed on the leader node.,ddb,
Describe the architecture of DynamoDB and how consistency is maintained.,"DynamoDB’s architecture consists of a leader node and storage nodes. The leader is elected and if it fails, another leader node is elected. Changes to the DB occur in the leader first and are replicated to the storage nodes.",ddb,
What kinds of reads are possible in DynamoDB?,"Eventually consistent reads, strongly consistent reads",ddb,
"Pricing-wise, how do eventually consistent reads compare with strongly consistent reads?",Eventually consistent reads’ RCU cost is half that of strongly consistent reads.,ddb,
What are the disadvantages of strongly consistent reads? What causes these disadvantages?,Strongly consistent reads are twice as expensive as eventually consistent reads. They do not scale as well since they always query the leader node.,ddb,
Suppose you need to store 10 items per second with an average item size of 2.5 KB. How many WCUs are required?,"2.5 KB rounded up = 3 KB. 10 of these per second comes out to 30 KB per second. One WCU = 1 KB, so 30 WCUs are required to accommodate this load.",ddb,
How many RCUs are required to retrieve 10 items per second with an average item size of 2.5 KB? Answer for both strongly consistent and eventually consistent reads.,"Each item is 2.5 KB, which fit in one RCU (remember that ops always consume at least one capacity unit). 10 of these items will take up 10 RCU if using SC reads. If using EC reads, half the amount is needed: 5 RCU.",ddb,
